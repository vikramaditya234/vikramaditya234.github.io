<h2 id="what-is-aws-and-why-we-need-it">What is AWS and why we need it</h2>
<p>Not long time ago the only way to host website, API service etc was renting or buying a server on a farm, which was could be a big sales process with plenty hidden cost, process delays and inflexibilities. Any change to this setup could mean repeating the process over again. Then came AWS (Amazon Web Services) and changed all that helping you to book servers whenever you want for whatever duration and almost any number. Upgrading and increasing the number of servers is litrally a mouse click away best of all “Pay for what you use”. To top it all you can experiment most of the services for FREE for a year.</p>

<p>I would recommed you to create a “Free tier” account in AWS and try the services at no cost.</p>

<h2 id="aws-console">AWS Console</h2>
<p>When you <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com">login</a> to your AWS account you would get page very similar to this <aws1.png>. 
This is AWS console and we are going to introduce to different services using the console. AWS do also provide rich CLI (Command Line Interface) commands.
Click on "Services" (top left on the page), it will list all the services offered by AWS. In most of the cases clicking on these services will show introduction page which can provide valuable information about it. So click on various services to see what they are about.</aws1.png></p>

<h2 id="creating-your-first-server">Creating your first server</h2>
<p>Exciting time! You are going to create your own server in AWS cloud, in few minutes and if you are using AWS Free tier account, then at no cost to you.
Lets start</p>

<p>Once you login to AWS account you would see</p>
