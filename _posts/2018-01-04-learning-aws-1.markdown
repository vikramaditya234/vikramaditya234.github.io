Upgrading and increasing the number of servers is litrally a mouse click away best of all "Pay for what you use". To top it all you can experiment most of the services for FREE for a year.

I would recommed you to create a "Free tier" account in AWS and try the services at no cost.

When you [login](http://console.aws.amazon.com) to your AWS account you would get page very similar to this <aws1.png>. 
This is AWS console and we are going to introduce to different services using the console. AWS do also provide rich CLI (Command Line Interface) commands.
Click on "Services" (top left on the page), it will list all the services offered by AWS. In most of the cases clicking on these services will show introduction page which can provide valuable information about it. So click on various services to see what they are about.
