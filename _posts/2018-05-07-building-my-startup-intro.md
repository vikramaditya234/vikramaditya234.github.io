# Introduction

I have been thinking of a problem that affects and will affect most of us. It's about taking care of our and our loved ones health. Yes there are hospitals and doctors that do their job well, but I felt there was a bit missing to make the magic of modern technology and medicine happen. Simple idea someone/something that keeps track of your health and what's available out there and match up the two to keep you 100% of self. Simple isn't it. :)

After thinking a lot I decided to make this idea a reality. As a part of the journey I will be writing blogs to hopefully inspire others and as a journal (kinda) for myself to come back and relive those moments of fun, despair, frustrations, anxiety and much more. It's a rock 'n' roll ride after all and if not then where is the fun.
