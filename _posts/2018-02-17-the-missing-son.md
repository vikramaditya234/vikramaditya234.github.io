Another great episode by Invisibilia about how we assume things when it comes to our dear ones. How we make decisions on behalf of others without asking and how we continue to perform our “duties” without stopping and asking what is expected of us. This episode is about a mother and her sons, whom she raised with military like discipline making sure all is given in right quantity, love, care, punishment. As sons grew up and moved out of the mother's house as asked; mother took a tenant in to fill the space in the empty house and get extra cash. The tenant was Mr Zhu; same age as of the son, a mild mannered quite man, bachelor with no whereabouts his family. Mr Zhu was more than an average tenant, he took good care of the mother, made her breakfast, took interest in her relatives, accompanied her for social gathering and became so close to her that he came to knew most all the conversations of past and present between mother and the sons. He became so dear to her that he was allowed to scold her and correct her when she was wrong, something her sons couldn't even dare to think. It was like she found her missing son, in her own admission she is been happier with Mr Zhu than with her sons. This is in spite the fact they did whatever she asked them to do, no questions asked. Mr Zhu was her favourite son she never had.

Is the cause of this sorrow was her own creation? She raised her sons to be obedient and when they grew up she hoped them to be more independent and "take responsibility", but because of the training over the years they still obeyed her. Instead if the sons were little rebellious and assertive she might have been happier with them, while contrary to her teaching. They didn't take control and at the same time she didn't surrendered her regime, hence her responsibilities always stood between her and the sons.

As a parent you are always trying to find the balance between disciplining the kids and letting them lose so they could discover themselves. Also true in work place where you would take control of the things in the beginning (of career/role) and as things more stable, you start to loosen up; letting team decide the best course for themselves, while you take the back seat of being an advisor. But this giving away of power and sometimes allowing things go wrong in your watch for sake of learning is not easy. Especially challenging in case of the family due drastic changes in the external environment, biology and family dynamics as kids grow up.

Anyhow, what struck the most in this story is the fact the mother had distanced herself from her own sons and found a son in complete stranger. This isolation and disappointment in her sons was sadly her own creation. I find this philosophical: *human responsible for his own misery*
