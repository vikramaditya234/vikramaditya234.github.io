Reading the book [Megachange: The World in 2050](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12875511-megachange), I came across a very interesting quote. Itâ€™s not just the quote but that context in which it is placed that made it more interesting.

Author argues that as nations become richer people become less religious and fundamentalism decreases, which is true in most of the developed nations where religious bodies are losing ground in all areas. But then there is "American exception" although America is developed nation but is still more religious than its other counterparts like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. This exception makes America more like a poor nation than a rich one.

"Life expectancy in America is not in top 10 or 20, not even in top 30 countries. It ranks 34th out of the UN's member states. It is the only developed state without universal health care: well over 40m people have no health insurance and illness often means financial ruin, even for the relatively well off. Welfare safety nets are poor by European standards: lose your job and you may well lose everything. Poverty and economic inequality are strikingly high. It is a violent country: the murder rate is by far the highest in the developed world and much larger proportion of Americans are incarcerated than in any other rich nation. In short, Americans live closer to disaster than the citizens of other countries. They are especially in need of God, because nobody else will help them"
