I had been waiting for flyers to start marketing but I still didn't had the payment gateway on the website or any other way to register the client, take money and give them invoice. My founder was adamant in getting user acceptance first before putting money for company registration, condition was to get 10 users who would agree in buying the product. So on Saturday morning I headed to the location where I thought will get most customers. Travelling in the train it occured to me that I am on long journey to create and run the company, with lots of what-ifs. What if nobody talks to me today, what if I don't get desired number of customers to run it profitably, what if I don't get enough money for initial start, what if this and that. Think this and feeling depressed, all of a sudden the idea came, why not ditch the whole quest and go home and watch the movie. No major investment had been done, I just tell everyone that I dropped the idea for whatever reason (or no reason). By now I am depressed and feeling pretty pathetic, my feet became heavy as though there are weights tied to them and at some point I even felt I had cramp in my calf muscles. The power of mind can make you believe and do any and everything. This was lot worse than what I had felt when I was doing surveys and asking random people questions, at least then I had an excuse (for myself) that I am not selling and and researching. The reason for all this fears and thoughts as I later realized was lack of breakfast aka lack of energy to channel my brain.

While deep in all these wasteful thoughts I remembered a saying "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" and solve today's problem tomorrow's problem will solve themselves. Soon I got these thoughts by overwhelmingly depressing thoughts just vanished. Now I was travelling to my destination with renowned enthusiasm. These words and sayings are great aren't they? Thankfully they came to my mind ontime, else this blog won't have been written :)

Lesson learned:
1. Breakfast is important meal of the day
2. Always listen to motivational saying, videos, speeches
3. Today's problem will end today and will fight tomorrow's problem tomorrow
4. Problem can be as big as you want it to be
5. It's all in your head
