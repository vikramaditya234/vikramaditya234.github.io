This is the other Idea that I had apart from Borvo Care.

Event management idea came from the need to share pics and information about picnics/parties when arranged for a group. Whatsapp was workable but not optimum for this service. As I thought more about it I realized possibilities of more use of this tool. One of the obvious one was to provide its access to event managers and other service providers in the field. Now when you create the event these service providers can then pitch you their offers thereby becoming a marketplace. According to my assessment this market is $10B in Australia alone, think about it kids birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and many more. To top it all there is no competition. The idea seemed good people liked it but I couldn't think of working in that industry for 10 years or so. So not for me, this is up for grab send me message if you want to know what the monetization plan was and how to market the app etc.
