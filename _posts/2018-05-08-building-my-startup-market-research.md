I wanted to know what is the actual problem people were facing in this area. Talking to strangers on the road was easy and found people were willing to talk, but soon I got the survey out it everything changed. People ran in all directions. It immediately made me realize how people doing survey on the road feel, especially when I am not willing to share my thoughts. For record I am more than willing to help those poor souls, but sometimes you are not in the "mood". This experience made me respect what those people do and be more respectful towards them. I did couple of surveys like filling out form to find the problem around the topic, took my initial flyers to people for their thoughts. It took 3 iterations of flyers before I got it right and at the sametime learned how to approach people.

Talking to people with flyers in hand made me appear like a salesman, though I was not even actively selling and this made me hesitate to first couple of guys. The feeling is very much like asking a girl out except in this case if they agree to talk and provide valuable feedback, there is no girl to date. So you hearts pound, feet becomes concrete blocks and you stammer, with the fear of rejection you approach people and sometimes they say yes and sometimes are supportive of the idea. This support from first couple of guys help in propel me to talk to next 10, hence it was important for me to choose those first few carefully.

My target audience was Indian working professional and I found guys more receptive than girls, maybe I didn't know how approach girls (I should have practiced more in college :) ). Lunch time was the best time to talk to people and sunny Fridays are the best days. I once forced myself on to a group of friends waiting for the train, thankfully they didn't berate me but that made me aware of how in my excitement I can get overwhelming for other person. So I have to constantly correct myself to tone down, after all I am excited to build the company they are not :)

Lessons learned:
1. Talk to people when are relaxing but not resting
2. Talking to group is better than individuals sometimes but you have to find your entry
3. I thought people will be willing to talk when travelling to/from work in train, but I was quickly proved wrong
4. Market research is very important, you are designing business for people not for yourself, hence ask them what they need
5. People can't articulate what they need but have clear idea what they would like. Learn to read the between the lines
