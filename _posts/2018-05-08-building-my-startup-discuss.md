# Discuss the idea

First lesson of lean startup, before doing anything else discuss your ideas with as many people as possible. So that's what I did. Actually I had two ideas that was trying to run with this one (Borvo Care) and other was around event management (Read here). Talking to people it became clear Borvo Care was the winner of two, people instantly related to it and not just Indians but people from other countries too. I know it always difficult to share your idea with people what if they laugh, tease you, criticize the idea and worst of all if they steal it. Obviously you start with your close friends and family and don't worry no one is going to steal the idea. There are plenty of ideas out there, ideas have no value by itself but it's the implementation that matters.

The only time I was a little nervous discussing the idea was when I was talking to my CTO about it. But he was very supportive and provided good feedback and his reaction helped me take this more seriously.

After this I started talking to people (migrant Indians) on the street to see what do people do when it comes to taking care of family in India. Few things jumped out quicky one was if you ask for help people are more than happy to help you, people loves to give their view, they are capable of making logical decisions and this product is not for everyone. Now the question was how many people need this product and in what form?

Lesson learned:
1. Discuss your idea with as many people
2. People love to help but if you ask politely
3. Most wants to share their opinion, you just have to ask the right questions
