The project that you have planned so carefully has slipped, everyone in the team was on-board with the plan and you even buffered 20% as contingency. Yet the project missed the deadline and this was not the first time and won’t be the last time. The good news is it’s not just you and the bad news is it’s a global problem. Companies big or small from likes of Google and Facebook to government project all struggle with this problem. Some statistics, all infrastructure projects of value more than $1B across the world add up to $6-$9T per year (equal to 8% of world GDP) due to missed deadlines. **All projects suffer from this problem.**

This problem is *Planning fallacy*, in simple term it is over expectation from oneself, team, environment (optimism bias) and expectation of ideal conditions (where nothing goes wrong) resulting in underestimating the time and resources needed for the project. This doesn't mean optimism bias is evil; it keeps all of us hopeful and pushes to reach for stars. Optimism bias arises from human desire to be better than what he is today, it can be linked to ones desire to improve and self-worth, ones pride. The major causes of planning fallacy are over-confidence, interference, incompetence and fraud. In some cases planning fallacy is intentional, like when trying to impress the customers about your company/product, winning a project bid, in interviews where positive sounding candidates get rewarded, in designing marketing campaigns and also politicians promising brighter tomorrow. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai said in an interview “If you don't fail sometimes, you are not being ambitious enough”, the way I look at it is planning fallacy by design. Planning fallacy can add up to 40% project budget, there is global effort to fix it which can be proved with the rise of various project planning services.

UK government implemented an innovative solution to solve this by introducing *Green Book*. There was a constant cost and time overrun of projects, due to *Planning fallacy* introduced by competitive bidding. Green book tracks public spending and its historical data helps government find deviation between estimates and actual and apply this deviation to existing projects to get more realistic picture. As good as it sounds this can quickly become a vicious cycle as companies compete to stand out. To counter this problem government introduced another solution; putting contractor's skin in the game where timely completion of the project is rewarded and delays are punished, hence incentivising saner estimates. This system was found in 2004 and in an outside analysis found project overrun reduced to 7%.

Unfortunately there is no universal solution but there are a few good practices that can help like reference-class forecasting. This is used by meteorologist to provide accurate forecast of weather, by tracking their past performance and acting on deviation. Using algorithms like used by amazon to deliver stuff to your door on time, always. But many times these solutions cannot be employed due to time and effort to needed to establish the system, lack of historical data, acumen to understand the problem and implement solution.

Efficient project management can help counter the effect, like breaking the project in smaller chunks with regular update and scope for course correction; this can reduce overruns and nasty surprises. Study have found smaller teams are more effective than larger ones (heard of two-pizza team?), have smaller and fewer meetings

Bottom line is no matter how much you try to avoid it; planning fallacy will still sneak in. Better is embrace it and work around it, best of all you now have a global phenomenon to blame your project delay.

Share your ideas on planning fallacy, how do you counter it?
